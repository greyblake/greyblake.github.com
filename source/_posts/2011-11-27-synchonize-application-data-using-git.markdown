I started writing a diary using [rednotebook](http://rednotebook.sourceforge.net) application. It's realy cool, but I stuck with a problem: I want to use it everywhere on any device and keep all my notes synchonized. So I decided to create a simple tool called **gync** to help me.

Please check it out on Github: [https://github.com/greyblake/gync](https://github.com/greyblake/gync)

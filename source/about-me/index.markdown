{% img left /images/sergey_potapov.png Sergey Potapov %}


My name is Sergey Potapov, I'm a ruby developer and a linuxoid from Kharkov(Ukraine).
My favorite text editor is Vim and I am little bit crazy about it.

I am an open source guy and do some minor contributions to ruby projects.
Also I maintain my own [projects](/projects) as well.

My craft is a web deveopment. Besides I love to investigate ruby and its subtle behaviour.
I'm interesting in artificial intelligence algorithms and their application.

In my spare time I play guitar, rink, learn foreign languages(English, German)
and think about making the world better.

{% img left /images/sergey_potapov.png Sergey Potapov %}

My name is Sergey Potapov, I'm a rust and ruby developer as well as Linux fan, located in Berlin.
My favorite text editor is Vim and I am crazy about it =)

I am an open source enthusiast, so contribute to variety of projects in Rust, Ruby and Crystal.
Also I maintain my own [projects](/projects) as well.

My craft is web development, but my interests in computer science are much wider. They include
computer linguistics, artificial intelligence, blockchain, system programming and
algorithms.

In spare time I travel, play guitar, rink, learn foreign languages(Esperanto, German, Spanish),
fold origami and try to make the world a little bit better.

## About the blog

Sometimes I feel like I have to share something I've discovered.
That's how this blog is being written.
You will find there a number of interesting articles about Rust, Ruby, Linux, Vim
and some other hackers' stuff.
